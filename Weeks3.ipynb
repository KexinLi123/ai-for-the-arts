    "   - We create a variable called `message`.\n",

    "2. **Using the Variable**  \n",
    "   `print(message)`\n",

    "1. **Function definition**\n",
    "   - `def say_hello(name=\"World\"):` defines a function named `say_hello` with one parameter `name`.\n",
    "   - The `name` parameter has a default value of `\"World\"`, so calling `say_hello()` without arguments uses that default.\n",

    "   - `\"\"\"Return a greeting for the given name.\"\"\"` is a short description (optional) explaining what the function does.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Return value**\n",
    "   - `return f\"Hello, {name}!\"` builds and returns a string. `return` sends the result back to the caller; it does not print it.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Calling the function**\n",
    "   - `say_hello()` calls the function and returns the greeting for the default name.\n",
    "   - `say_hello(\"Alice\")` passes a specific argument and returns a personalized greeting.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Why use functions?**\n",
    "   - Functions group related code into a reusable block.\n",
    "   - They make programs easier to read, test, and maintain.\n",
    "   - Parameters let functions be flexible; return values let callers use results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key aspects to notice:**\n",
    "- A function does not run until you call it.\n",
    "- Use parameters to pass data into functions.\n",
    "- Use `return` to send results back; use `print()` when you want to display output.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want, I can also show examples with multiple parameters, default values, or how to store the function result in a variable before printing."

    "### Step-by-step explanation of the import example\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Import a library**\n",
    "   - `import math` — brings in the `math` library, which has math functions and constants built-in.\n",
    "   - Without importing, you cannot use functions like `sqrt()` or constants like `pi`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Access library items using dot notation**\n",
    "   - `math.pi` — accesses the constant `pi` from the `math` library. The dot (`.`) means \"inside\" or \"from\".\n",
    "   - `math.sqrt(16)` — calls the `sqrt()` function from the `math` library to calculate square root.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Using library functions for calculations**\n",
    "   - `math.pi * radius ** 2` — uses the library's `pi` constant to calculate the area of a circle.\n",
    "   - `math.sqrt()`, `math.fabs()`, etc. — are ready-to-use functions that do specific jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Import specific items directly**\n",
    "   - `from math import sqrt, ceil` — instead of using `math.sqrt()`, you can now call `sqrt()` directly.\n",
    "   - This is useful when you use the same function many times (saves typing `math.` each time).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Why use libraries?**\n",
    "   - Libraries are pre-written code that solve common problems.\n",
    "   - They save you time — no need to write `sqrt()` yourself.\n",
    "   - They are tested and reliable.\n",
    "   - Python comes with many built-in libraries (like `math`, `random`, `datetime`).\n",
    "   - You can also install and use external libraries (like `numpy`, `pandas`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key aspects to notice:**\n",
    "- `import` brings in a whole library; you must use dot notation (e.g., `math.sqrt`).\n",
    "- `from ... import ...` brings in specific items; you can use them directly (e.g., `sqrt`).\n",
    "- Libraries extend what Python can do without writing everything from scratch.\n",
    "- Common built-in libraries: `math`, `random`, `datetime`, `os`, `sys`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Small exercises to try\n",
    "- Import the `random` library and use `random.randint(1, 10)` to print a random number.\n",
    "- Use `from datetime import datetime` and call `datetime.now()` to print the current date and time.\n",
    "- Explore the `math` library: try `math.sin()`, `math.cos()`, or `math.factorial()` for more math operations."

    "### Step-by-step explanation of if/elif/else\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The `if` statement — checks a single condition**\n",
    "   - `if time < 12:` checks if the variable `time` is less than 12.\n",
    "   - If true, the code inside the `if` block runs (print \"Good morning!\").\n",
    "   - If false, Python skips to the next condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The `elif` statement — checks additional conditions**\n",
    "   - `elif time < 18:` means \"else if\" — only checked if the previous `if` was false.\n",
    "   - If this condition is true, the code runs (print \"Good afternoon!\").\n",
    "   - You can have multiple `elif` statements in a row.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **The `else` statement — fallback when all conditions are false**\n",
    "   - `else:` runs if all previous `if` and `elif` conditions were false.\n",
    "   - No condition is needed for `else` — it's the default/catch-all.\n",
    "   - In the example, if time is 18 or later, \"Good evening!\" prints.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **How it flows**\n",
    "   - Python evaluates conditions from top to bottom.\n",
    "   - Once one condition is true and its code runs, Python skips all remaining `elif` and `else` blocks.\n",
    "   - You only get one output per `if/elif/else` chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Comparison operators used in conditions**\n",
    "   - `<` less than\n",
    "   - `>` greater than\n",
    "   - `<=` less than or equal to\n",
    "   - `>=` greater than or equal to\n",
    "   - `==` equal to (note: two equals signs)\n",
    "   - `!=` not equal to\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Indentation is critical**\n",
    "   - Code inside `if`, `elif`, and `else` blocks must be indented (pushed to the right).\n",
    "   - Python uses indentation to know which code belongs to which condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key aspects to notice:**\n",
    "- `if` starts the decision chain.\n",
    "- `elif` allows multiple conditions to be checked in order.\n",
    "- `else` is optional and catches everything not caught by `if`/`elif`.\n",
    "- Only one block runs per chain (the first true condition).\n",
    "- Conditions evaluate to True or False.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Small exercises to try\n",
    "- Change the `time` variable to different values (0, 6, 15, 22) and run the code again to see different outputs.\n",
    "- Change the `age` variable and see how the message changes.\n",
    "- Create your own `if/elif/else` chain: ask yourself for a number and print whether it's even or odd using `num % 2 == 0`.\n",
    "- Use `and` / `or` operators: e.g., `if age >= 18 and score >= 80:` (both true) or `if score < 50 or attendance < 80:` (either true)."

    "\n",
    "**1. Arithmetic Operators (work with numbers)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `+` addition: `10 + 3 = 13`\n",
    "- `-` subtraction: `10 - 3 = 7`\n",
    "- `*` multiplication: `10 * 3 = 30`\n",
    "- `/` division: `10 / 3 = 3.333...` (always returns float)\n",
    "- `//` floor division: `10 // 3 = 3` (returns integer, rounds down)\n",
    "- `%` modulo: `10 % 3 = 1` (remainder after division)\n",
    "- `**` exponentiation: `10 ** 3 = 1000` (10 to the power of 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. String Operations (work with text)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Concatenation (addition)**: `\"Hello\" + \" \" + \"World\"` produces `\"Hello World\"`\n",
    "  - You combine strings together using the `+` operator.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Repetition (multiplication)**: `\"Ha\" * 3` produces `\"HaHaHa\"`\n",
    "  - You repeat a string a certain number of times using `*` with a number.\n",
    "  - Example: `\"-\" * 20` creates a line of 20 dashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Important**: You **cannot directly add a string and a number**\n",
    "  - `\"Hello\" + 5` causes an error because Python doesn't know how to add text and a number.\n",
    "  - **Solution**: Convert the number to a string first: `\"Hello\" + str(5)` produces `\"Hello5\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Comparison Operators (return True or False)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `>` greater than: `15 > 10` is `True`\n",
    "- `<` less than: `15 < 10` is `False`\n",
    "- `>=` greater than or equal: `15 >= 15` is `True`\n",
    "- `<=` less than or equal: `15 <= 20` is `True`\n",
    "- `==` equal to: `15 == 15` is `True` (note: two equals signs)\n",
    "- `!=` not equal to: `15 != 10` is `True`\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Logical Operators (combine True/False values)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `and`: Both conditions must be true. Example: `age >= 18 and score >= 80` is true only if both are true.\n",
    "- `or`: At least one condition must be true. Example: `age < 18 or score >= 80` is true if either is true.\n",
    "- `not`: Reverses the value. Example: `not True` is `False`, and `not False` is `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Operator Precedence (order of operations)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python follows standard math rules:\n",
    "1. `**` (exponentiation) — highest priority\n",
    "2. `*`, `/`, `//`, `%` (multiplication and division) — next\n",
    "3. `+`, `-` (addition and subtraction) — lowest priority\n",
    "\n",
    "Use parentheses `()` to override precedence: `(2 + 3) * 4` gives `20`, not `14`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key aspects to notice:**\n",
    "- Different operators work with different data types (numbers vs strings).\n",
    "- String concatenation uses `+`, string repetition uses `*` with a number.\n",
    "- Comparison operators return True or False — used in `if` statements.\n",
    "- Logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) combine conditions for complex decisions.\n",
    "- Always convert numbers to strings before concatenating with text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Small exercises to try\n",
    "- Try: `\"Python\" + \" is \" + \"fun\"` and see the result.\n",
    "- Try: `\"Code\" * 2` and see the repetition.\n",
    "- Try: `\"Number: \" + str(42)` to concatenate a string and a number.\n",
    "- Create variables `x = 20` and `y = 15`, then test: `x > y and x != y`, `x < y or x == 20`.\n",
    "- Change parentheses in math: `2 + 3 * 4` vs `(2 + 3) * 4` and see the difference."

    "**Principle**: Support multiple languages, consider accessibility, and include diverse users.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal**: Write code that works for people with different languages, abilities, and backgrounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key aspects**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Multilingual Support** — Provide greetings in multiple languages.\n",
    "   - Users worldwide can see the program in their native language.\n",
    "   - Respects cultural and linguistic diversity.\n",
    "   - Shows that programming is for everyone, not just English speakers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Clear Variable and Function Names** — Use meaningful names that anyone can understand.\n",
    "   - `print_greeting_multilingual()` is much clearer than `pg()` or `func()`.\n",
    "   - Beginners and people learning English can understand code better.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Comprehensive Documentation** — Include docstrings and comments that explain everything.\n",
    "   - Docstrings help screen readers and accessibility tools.\n",
    "   - Non-native English speakers benefit from clear explanations.\n",
    "   - Lists available languages so users know what to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Helpful Error Messages** — Tell users exactly what went wrong and how to fix it.\n",
    "   - Instead of a cryptic error, show: `Language 'unknown' not supported. Available: en, es, fr, de, ja, ar, zh`\n",
    "   - Beginners understand what they need to do next.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Accessibility Considerations**:\n",
    "   - **Screen readers** — Clear variable names and structure help screen readers read code aloud.\n",
    "   - **Color-blind friendly** — No reliance on color to convey meaning (just text).\n",
    "   - **Cognitive accessibility** — Organized, readable code is easier for everyone to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Code Structure** — Organized in a way that's easy to follow.\n",
    "   - Dictionary structure makes it easy to add new languages.\n",
    "   - Function parameters let users customize behavior.\n",
    "   - Clear comments explain each step.\n",

    "**Why this matters**:\n",
    "- **Inclusivity** — Not everyone's first language is English.\n",
    "- **Accessibility** — People with disabilities benefit from clear code structure.\n",

    "**Principle**: Validate input, handle errors gracefully, and protect against misuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal**: Write code that fails safely and prevents common security issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key aspects**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input Validation** — Check that input is the correct type (string) before using it.\n",
    "   - `isinstance(message, str)` verifies the input is actually a string.\n",
    "   - Prevents accidental misuse or intentional attacks using wrong types.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Error Handling with Try-Except** — Catch potential errors and handle them gracefully.\n",
    "   - If someone passes a number instead of text, the error is caught and reported clearly.\n",
    "   - The program doesn't crash; it tells the user what went wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Type Hints and Docstrings** — Document what types are expected.\n",
    "   - `message (str):` tells developers what type to use.\n",
    "   - Docstrings explain what the function does and what can go wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Defensive Programming** — Assume something could go wrong and plan for it.\n",
    "   - Check for empty strings: `if not message.strip():` prevents printing nothing.\n",
    "   - Use descriptive error messages: `f\"Expected string, but got {type(message).__name__}\"` helps debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **PEP 8 Compliance** — Follow Python's style guide for consistency and security.\n",
    "   - Proper function naming, documentation, and error messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters**:\n",
    "- **Robustness** — Code handles edge cases gracefully.\n",
    "- **Debugging** — Clear error messages help find and fix problems.\n",
    "- **User protection** — Validates data before processing it.\n",
    "- **Professional code** — Security-conscious code is expected in real-world applications.\n",
