    "   - We create a variable called `message`.\n",
    "   - The `=` sign assigns the value `\"Hello, world!\"` to the variable.\n",

    "   `print(message)`\n",
    "   - The `print()` function displays information on the screen.\n",
    "   - Instead of printing the text directly, we print the value stored in the variable `message`.\n",
    "   - This shows how variables can be used to store and reuse information.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Function definition**\n",
    "   - `def say_hello(name=\"World\"):` defines a function named `say_hello` with one parameter `name`.\n",
    "   - The `name` parameter has a default value of `\"World\"`, so calling `say_hello()` without arguments uses that default.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Docstring**\n",
    "   - `\"\"\"Return a greeting for the given name.\"\"\"` is a short description (optional) explaining what the function does.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Return value**\n",
    "   - `return f\"Hello, {name}!\"` builds and returns a string. `return` sends the result back to the caller; it does not print it.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Calling the function**\n",
    "   - `say_hello()` calls the function and returns the greeting for the default name.\n",
    "   - `say_hello(\"Alice\")` passes a specific argument and returns a personalized greeting.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Why use functions?**\n",
    "   - Functions group related code into a reusable block.\n",
    "   - They make programs easier to read, test, and maintain.\n",
    "   - Parameters let functions be flexible; return values let callers use results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key aspects to notice:**\n",
    "- A function does not run until you call it.\n",
    "- Use parameters to pass data into functions.\n",
    "- Use `return` to send results back; use `print()` when you want to display output.\n",
